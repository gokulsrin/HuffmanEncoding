Hello Scott,

I'm writing this to outline my test files to make your life a bit easier. The boundary cases that I tested were

1.) empty file
2.) single character file
3.) repeating single character file
4.) standard file

All four of these cases work properly, and you can test them in the boundary test class as well as the maindriver class.
Within most of my main classes, there are main methods included to test some of this functionality.
Simply adjust what's in the "testtext.txt" file found in the input folder to test each of these cases.

The main driver class for the compression and decompression of the US Consitution and War And Peace is the file "MainDriver".
Adjust this class and the file variables within it to test as you please.

I hope this is easy for you to grade.
